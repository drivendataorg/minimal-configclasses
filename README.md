# minimal-configclasses

**A minimal Python library for creating config classes: a data class that can load defaults from other sources.**

- A sane default implemention that merges values from environment variables, `pyproject.toml` files, named config files in conventional locations.
- A simple API for defining custom config data sources and for resolving data from multiple sources.
- Zero dependencies for 3.11 or higher, and only standard library backports for lower Python versions.
